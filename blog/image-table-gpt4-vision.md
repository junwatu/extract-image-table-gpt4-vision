# Processing Image Data using GPT4-Vision, Node.js, and GridDB


![blog-gpt4-cover](blog-gpt4-cover.jpg)

In this blog, we will explore how to use GPT-4 Vision to process image data, specifically tabular data from image and store the results in GridDB. We will build a simple web application using React.js and Node.js that allows users to upload images and view the results of GPT-4V's image processing.

## Meet the Stacks

We will use Node.js, GridDB, and OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision. For user interface, we will use React.js.

### What is GPT-4 Vision? 

GPT-4 with Vision, sometimes referred to as GPT-4V is one of the OpenAI's product. It allows the model to take in images and answer questions about them. Historically, language model systems have been limited by taking in a single input modality, text. For many use cases, this constrained the areas where models like GPT-4 could be used.

You can read more about GPT-4V in their official [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

### What is GridDB?

GridDB is an open-source, in-memory NoSQL database that is optimized for IoT and big data applications. It is a highly scalable database that can handle large volumes of data with high throughput and low latency. GridDB is also ACID compliant and supports SQL-like queries. 

For more information about GridDB, please visit the [GridDB website](https://griddb.net/).

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable network applications. It is built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

### What is React.js?

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React.js allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be used across different applications.
