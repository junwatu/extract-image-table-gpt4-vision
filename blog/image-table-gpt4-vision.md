# Processing Image Data using GPT4-Vision, Node.js, and GridDB

![blog-gpt4-cover](assets/blog-gpt4-cover.jpg)

In this blog, we will explore how to use GPT-4 Vision to process image data, specifically tabular data from image and store the results in GridDB. We will build a simple web application using React.js and Node.js that allows users to upload images and view the results of GPT-4V's image processing.

## Meet the Stacks

We will use Node.js, GridDB, and OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision. For user interface, we will use React.js.

### GPT-4 Vision

GPT-4 with Vision, sometimes referred to as GPT-4V is one of the OpenAI's product. It allows the model to take in images and answer questions about them. Historically, language model systems have been limited by taking in a single input modality, text. For many use cases, this constrained the areas where models like GPT-4 could be used. You can read more about GPT-4V in their official [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).

### GridDB

GridDB is an open-source, in-memory NoSQL database that is optimized for IoT and big data applications. It is a highly scalable database that can handle large volumes of data with high throughput and low latency. GridDB is also ACID compliant and supports SQL-like queries. For more information about GridDB, please visit the [GridDB website](https://griddb.net/).

### Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable network applications. It is built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. For more information about Node.js, please visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### React.js

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React.js allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be used across different applications. For more information about React.js, please visit the [React.js website](https://reactjs.org/).

## Installation

This project is tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS WSL 2. You need OpenAI API key, GridDB, Node.js, and React.js to run this project. You can install them by following the instructions below.

### Install Node.js

To install Node.js v20 LTS on Ubuntu using package manager, you need to add additional `deb` repository. Please read and follow this [documentation](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu-versions). After that test if the Node.js installed correctly by typing this command in the terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

### Install GridDB

The GridDB documentation for installation in Ubuntu on WSL can be found [here](https://docs.griddb.net/latest/gettingstarted/wsl/#installing-wsl). To check if GridDB is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status gridstore
```




### Get OpenAI API Key

You can get OpenAI API key by signing up for an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys/). To keep your API key safe, you can store it in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The `.env` file should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

and add `.env` to `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to the repository.
