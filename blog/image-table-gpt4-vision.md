# Processing Image Data using GPT4-Vision, Node.js, and GridDB

## Introduction

### What is GPT-4 Vision? 
{/* Overview of GPT4-Vision and its capabilities */}

GPT-4 with Vision, sometimes referred to as GPT-4V is one of the OpenAI's product. It allows the model to take in images and answer questions about them. Historically, language model systems have been limited by taking in a single input modality, text. For many use cases, this constrained the areas where models like GPT-4 could be used.

In this blog, we will explore how to use GPT-4V to process image data and store the results in GridDB. We will also build a simple web application that allows users to upload images and view the results of GPT-4V's image processing.
